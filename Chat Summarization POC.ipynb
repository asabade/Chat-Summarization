       "'The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive action since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s. While the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it feeds into a multitude of consumer products such as adjustable mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The increase takes the funds rate to its highest level since December 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkets largely expected the move after Fed officials telegraphed the increase in a series of statements since the June meeting. Stocks hit their highs after Fed Chair Jerome Powell left the door open about its next move at the September meeting, saying it would depend on the data. Central bankers have emphasized the importance of bringing down inflation even if it means slowing the economy. \"As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation,\" Powell said.\\n\\nIn its post-meeting statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cautioned that \"recent indicators of spending and production have softened.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the committee added, using language similar to the June statement. Officials again described inflation as \"elevated\" and ascribed the situation to supply chain issues and higher prices for food and energy along with \"broader price pressures.\" Powell said he does not think the economy is in recession, though growth was negative in the first quarter and was expected to be barely positive in the second quarter. \"Think about what a recession is. It\\'s a broad-based decline across many industries that\\'s sustained more than a couple of months. This doesn\\'t seem like that now,\" he said. \"The real reason is the labor market has been such a strong signal of economic strength that it makes you question the GDP data.\" The rate hike was approved unanimously. In June, Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented, advocating a slower course with a half percentage point increase.\\n\\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\\n\\n\\n\\nThe increases come in a year that began with rates floating around zero but which has seen a commonly cited inflation measure run at 9.1% annually. The Fed aims for inflation around 2%, though it adjusted that goal in 2020 to allow it to run a bit hotter in the interest of full and inclusive employment. Powell said the Fed is \"strongly committed\" to reducing inflation and said that could come with a cost to general economic growth and the labor market in particular. \"We think it is necessary to have growth slow down. Growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons,\" he said. The economy, he added, probably will grow below its long-run trend for a period of time. \"We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack.\" In June, the unemployment rate held at 3.6%, close to full employment. But inflation, even by the Fed\\'s standard of core personal consumption expenditures, which was at 4.7% in May, is well off target.'"

    "text=\"\"\"In light of recent news from Apple, facial recognition technology is now the talk of the town. Ranging from privacy concerns to a curious boyfriend unlocking his girlfriend’s phone while she sleeps. The first commercial application of 3D facial recognition means that biometric technology is advancing at a staggering rate but so is the ability to hack or fool facial recognition tech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, 99% of the infrastructure scattered around the world consists of 2D cameras capable of running advanced facial recognition software and it will likely be years before a physical overhaul to 3D cameras takes place. Hackers, hobbyists, educators and the like have been developing creative ways to either fool or hide from 2D face recognition in a perpetually innovative game of cat and mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of 3D recognition will give way to an entirely new thought process of how to beat an incredibly advanced technology, and also raise some questions as to how and by whom it will be used. The fight is futile as the effort exerted to trick this technology is better spent working with the facial recognition companies to enforce acceptable regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I question the intention of these types of face recognition-fooling solutions. Are they for bad actors hoping to sneak away undetected? Are they for people who are concerned about their picture being stored in a massive database (I’d worry more about posting a picture to Facebook…)? Are they to demonstrate the inherent risk of biometric information?\n",
    "\n",
    "The variations that humans have designed to deceive the machine are more likely to make you stand out than blend in. Such as custom makeup, hairstyles, masks, a pair of glasses designed at Carnegie Melon consisting of camouflage patterns or simply wearing a box over your head. Some of them are realistic, but most are just for fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "As these techniques improve, so does the technology capable of identifying and training against them resulting in more robust face recognition software. These solutions seem like a great way to protect individuals who are looking to keep their identity hidden for nefarious reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further concern would be detecting an attempt to impersonate an individual by using a picture of their face. With 3D cameras, this type of hack is very difficult to achieve due to the complexity of depth measurements. Facial recognition technology can run liveness detection or use additional hardware for heat sensing, both of which are capable of being tricked to a degree as seen with Samsung and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "The availability of public facial images is far more concerning due to the ease of which you would be able to render a 3D model from a small set of images and use virtual reality tools to project a face.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface, these types of hacks would seem alarming but if gaining access to your phone now is as easy as guessing a 4-digit passcode, society should deem these tolerable risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately it is on facial recognition companies and Trueface to mitigate this risk by being more innovative, detecting consistencies in attacks and training the technology to identify when hacks occur. This game will continue to be played and become significantly more sophisticated with the adoption of 3D facial recognition.\n",

The gaps I mean,\\n    No one has seen them made or heard them made,\\n    But at spring mending-time we find them there.\\n    I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;\\n    And on a day we meet to walk the line\\n    And set the wall between us once again.\\n    We keep the wall between us as we go.\\n    To each the boulders that have fallen to each.\\n    And some are loaves and some so nearly balls\\n    We have to use a spell to make them balance:\\n    \"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!\"\\n    We wear our fingers rough with handling them.\\n    Oh, just another kind of out-door game,\\n    One on a side. It comes to little more:\\n    There where it is we do not need the wall:\\n    He is all pine and I am apple orchard.\\n    My apple trees will never get across\\n    And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.\\n    He only says, \"Good fences make good neighbours.\"\\n    Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder\\n    If I could put a notion in his head:\\n    \"Why do they make good neighbours? Isn\\'t it\\n    Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.\\n    Before I built a wall I\\'d ask to know\\n    What I was walling in or walling out,\\n    And to whom I was like to give offence.\\n    Something there is that doesn\\'t love a wall,\\n    That wants it down.\" I could say \"Elves\" to him,\\n    But it\\'s not elves exactly, and I\\'d rather\\n    He said it for himself. I see him there\\n    Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top\\n    In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.\\n    He moves in darkness as it seems to me,\\n    Not of woods only and the shade of trees.\\n    He will not go behind his father\\'s saying,\\n    And he likes having thought of it so well\\n    He says again, \"Good fences make good neighbours.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Death of the Hired Man\\n\\n    MARY sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table\\n    Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,\\n    She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage\\n    To meet him in the doorway with the news\\n    And put him on his guard. \"Silas is back.\"\\n    She pushed him outward with her through the door\\n    And shut it after her. \"Be kind,\" she said.\\n    She took the market things from Warren\\'s arms\\n    And set them on the porch, then drew him down\\n    To sit beside her on the wooden steps.\\n    \"When was I ever anything but kind to him?\\n    But I\\'ll not have the fellow back,\" he said.\\n    \"I told him so last haying, didn\\'t I?\\n    \\'If he left then,\\' I said, \\'that ended it.\\'\\n    What good is he? Who else will harbour him\\n    At his age for the little he can do?\\n    What help he is there\\'s no depending on.\\n    Off he goes always when I need him most.\\n    \\'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,\\n    Enough at least to buy tobacco with,\\n    So he won\\'t have to beg and be beholden.\\'\\n    \\'All right,\\' I say, \\'I can\\'t afford to pay\\n    Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.\\'\\n    \\'Someone else can.\\' \\'Then someone else will have to.\\'\\n    I shouldn\\'t mind his bettering himself\\n    If that was what it was. You can be certain,\\n    When he begins like that, there\\'s someone at him\\n    Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,--\\n    In haying time, when any help is scarce.\\n    In winter he comes back to us. I\\'m done.\"\\n    \"Sh! not so loud: he\\'ll hear you,\" Mary said.\\n    \"I want him to: he\\'ll have to soon or late.\"\\n    \"He\\'s worn out. He\\'s asleep beside the stove.\\n    When I came up from Rowe\\'s I found him here,\\n    Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,\\n    A miserable sight, and frightening, too--\\n    You needn\\'t smile--I didn\\'t recognise him--\\n    I wasn\\'t looking for him--and he\\'s changed.\\n    Wait till you see.\"\\n    \"Where did you say he\\'d been?\"\\n    \"He didn\\'t say. I dragged him to the house,\\n    And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.\\n    I tried to make him talk about his travels.\\n    Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.\"\\n    \"What did he say? Did he say anything?\"\\n    \"But little.\"\\n    \"Anything? Mary, confess\\n    He said he\\'d come to ditch the meadow for me.\"\\n    \"Warren!\"\\n    \"But did he? I just want to know.\"\\n    \"Of course he did. What would you have him say?\\n    Surely you wouldn\\'t grudge the poor old man\\n    Some humble way to save his self-respect.\\n    He added, if you really care to know,\\n    He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.\\n    That sounds like something you have heard before?\\n    Warren, I wish you could have heard the way\\n    He jumbled everything. I stopped to look\\n    Two or three times--he made me feel so queer--\\n    To see if he was talking in his sleep.\\n    He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember--\\n    The boy you had in haying four years since.\\n    He\\'s finished school, and teaching in his college.\\n    Silas declares you\\'ll have to get him back.\\n    He says they two will make a team for work:\\n    Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!\\n    The way he mixed that in with other things.\\n    He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft\\n    On education--you know how they fought\\n    All through July under the blazing sun,\\n    Silas up on the cart to build the load,\\n    Harold along beside to pitch it on.\"\\n    \"Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.\"\\n    \"Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.\\n    You wouldn\\'t think they would. How some things linger!\\n    Harold\\'s young college boy\\'s assurance piqued him.\\n    After so many years he still keeps finding\\n    Good arguments he sees he might have used.\\n    I sympathise. I know just how it feels\\n    To think of the right thing to say too late.\\n    Harold\\'s associated in his mind with Latin.\\n    He asked me what I thought of Harold\\'s saying\\n    He studied Latin like the violin\\n    Because he liked it--that an argument!\\n    He said he couldn\\'t make the boy believe\\n    He could find water with a hazel prong--\\n    Which showed how much good school had ever done him.\\n    He wanted to go over that. But most of all\\n    He thinks if he could have another chance\\n    To teach him how to build a load of hay----\"\\n    \"I know, that\\'s Silas\\' one accomplishment.\\n    He bundles every forkful in its place,\\n    And tags and numbers it for future reference,\\n    So he can find and easily dislodge it\\n    In the unloading. Silas does that well.\\n    He takes it out in bunches like big birds\\' nests.\\n    You never see him standing on the hay\\n    He\\'s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.\"\\n    \"He thinks if he could teach him that, he\\'d be\\n    Some good perhaps to someone in the world.\\n    He hates to see a boy the fool of books.\\n    Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,\\n    And nothing to look backward to with pride,\\n    And nothing to look forward to with hope,\\n    So now and never any different.\"\\n    Part of a moon was falling down the west,\\n    Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.\\n    Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw\\n    And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand\\n    Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,\\n    Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,\\n    As if she played unheard the tenderness\\n    That wrought on him beside her in the night.\\n    \"Warren,\" she said, \"he has come home to die:\\n    You needn\\'t be afraid he\\'ll leave you this time.\"\\n    \"Home,\" he mocked gently.\\n    \"Yes, what else but home?\\n    It all depends on what you mean by home.\\n    Of course he\\'s nothing to us, any more\\n    Than was the hound that came a stranger to us\\n    Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.\"\\n    \"Home is the place where, when you have to go there,\\n    They have to take you in.\"\\n    \"I should have called it\\n    Something you somehow haven\\'t to deserve.\"\\n    Warren leaned out and took a step or two,\\n    Picked up a little stick, and brought it back\\n    And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.\\n    \"Silas has better claim on us you think\\n    Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles\\n    As the road winds would bring him to his door.\\n    Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.\\n    Why didn\\'t he go there? His brother\\'s rich,\\n    A somebody--director in the bank.\"\\n    \"He never told us that.\"\\n    \"We know it though.\"\\n    \"I think his brother ought to help, of course.\\n    I\\'ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right\\n    To take him in, and might be willing to--\\n    He may be better than appearances.\\n    But have some pity on Silas. Do you think\\n    If he\\'d had any pride in claiming kin\\n    Or anything he looked for from his brother,\\n    He\\'d keep so still about him all this time?\"\\n    \"I wonder what\\'s between them.\"\\n    \"I can tell you.\\n    Silas is what he is--we wouldn\\'t mind him--\\n    But just the kind that kinsfolk can\\'t abide.\\n    He never did a thing so very bad.\\n    He don\\'t know why he isn\\'t quite as good\\n    As anyone. He won\\'t be made ashamed\\n    To please his brother, worthless though he is.\"\\n    \"I can\\'t think Si ever hurt anyone.\"\\n    \"No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay\\n    And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.\\n    He wouldn\\'t let me put him on the lounge.\\n    You must go in and see what you can do.\\n    I made the bed up for him there to-night.\\n    You\\'ll be surprised at him--how much he\\'s broken.\\n    His working days are done; I\\'m sure of it.\"\\n    \"I\\'d not be in a hurry to say that.\"\\n    \"I haven\\'t been. Go, look, see for yourself.\\n    But, Warren, please remember how it is:\\n    He\\'s come to help you ditch the meadow.\\n    He has a plan. You mustn\\'t laugh at him.\\n    He may not speak of it, and then he may.\\n    I\\'ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud\\n    Will hit or miss the moon.\"\\n    It hit the moon.\\n    Then there were three there, making a dim row,\\n    The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.\\n    Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,\\n    Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.\\n    \"Warren,\" she questioned.\\n    \"Dead,\" was all he answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Mountain\\n\\n    THE mountain held the town as in a shadow\\n    I saw so much before I slept there once:\\n    I noticed that I missed stars in the west,\\n    Where its black body cut into the sky.\\n    Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall\\n    Behind which I was sheltered from a wind.\\n    And yet between the town and it I found,\\n    When I walked forth at dawn to see new things,\\n    Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields.\\n    The river at the time was fallen away,\\n    And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones;\\n    But the signs showed what it had done in spring;\\n    Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass\\n    Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark.\\n    I crossed the river and swung round the mountain.\\n    And there I met a man who moved so slow\\n    With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart,\\n    It seemed no hand to stop him altogether.\\n    \"What town is this?\" I asked.\\n    \"This? Lunenburg.\"\\n    Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,\\n    Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,\\n    But only felt at night its shadowy presence.\\n    \"Where is your village? Very far from here?\"\\n    \"There is no village--only scattered farms.\\n    We were but sixty voters last election.\\n    We can\\'t in nature grow to many more:\\n    That thing takes all the room!\" He moved his goad.\\n    The mountain stood there to be pointed at.\\n    Pasture ran up the side a little way,\\n    And then there was a wall of trees with trunks:\\n    After that only tops of trees, and cliffs\\n    Imperfectly concealed among the leaves.\\n    A dry ravine emerged from under boughs\\n    Into the pasture.\\n    \"That looks like a path.\\n    Is that the way to reach the top from here?--\\n    Not for this morning, but some other time:\\n    I must be getting back to breakfast now.\"\\n    \"I don\\'t advise your trying from this side.\\n    There is no proper path, but those that have\\n    Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd\\'s.\\n    That\\'s five miles back. You can\\'t mistake the place:\\n    They logged it there last winter some way up.\\n    I\\'d take you, but I\\'m bound the other way.\"\\n    \"You\\'ve never climbed it?\"\\n    \"I\\'ve been on the sides\\n    Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There\\'s a brook\\n    That starts up on it somewhere--I\\'ve heard say\\n    Right on the top, tip-top--a curious thing.\\n    But what would interest you about the brook,\\n    It\\'s always cold in summer, warm in winter.\\n    One of the great sights going is to see\\n    It steam in winter like an ox\\'s breath,\\n    Until the bushes all along its banks\\n    Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles--\\n    You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!\"\\n    \"There ought to be a view around the world\\n    From such a mountain--if it isn\\'t wooded\\n    Clear to the top.\" I saw through leafy screens\\n    Great granite terraces in sun and shadow,\\n    Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up--\\n    With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet;\\n    Or turn and sit on and look out and down,\\n    With little ferns in crevices at his elbow.\\n    \"As to that I can\\'t say. But there\\'s the spring,\\n    Right on the summit, almost like a fountain.\\n    That ought to be worth seeing.\"\\n    \"If it\\'s there.\\n    You never saw it?\"\\n    \"I guess there\\'s no doubt\\n    About its being there. I never saw it.\\n    It may not be right on the very top:\\n    It wouldn\\'t have to be a long way down\\n    To have some head of water from above,\\n    And a good distance down might not be noticed\\n    By anyone who\\'d come a long way up.\\n    One time I asked a fellow climbing it\\n    To look and tell me later how it was.\"\\n    \"What did he say?\"\\n    \"He said there was a lake\\n    Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top.\"\\n    \"But a lake\\'s different. What about the spring?\"\\n    \"He never got up high enough to see.\\n    That\\'s why I don\\'t advise your trying this side.\\n    He tried this side.

The rascal, he said he\\'d be glad\\n    To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.\\n    There had been some berries--but those were all gone.\\n    He didn\\'t say where they had been. He went on:\\n    \\'I\\'m sure--I\\'m sure\\'--as polite as could be.\\n    He spoke to his wife in the door, \\'Let me see,\\n    Mame, we don\\'t know any good berrying place?\\'\\n    It was all he could do to keep a straight face.\\n    \"If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,\\n    He\\'ll find he\\'s mistaken.

As it is,\\n    The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,\\n    Sometimes we don\\'t. We\\'ve a good piece of shore\\n    That ought to be worth something, and may yet.\\n    But I don\\'t count on it as much as Len.\\n    He looks on the bright side of everything,\\n    Including me. He thinks I\\'ll be all right\\n    With doctoring. But it\\'s not medicine--\\n    Lowe is the only doctor\\'s dared to say so--\\n    It\\'s rest I want--there, I have said it out--\\n    From cooking meals for hungry hired men\\n    And washing dishes after them--from doing\\n    Things over and over that just won\\'t stay done.\\n    By good rights I ought not to have so much\\n    Put on me, but there seems no other way.\\n    Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.\\n    He says the best way out is always through.\\n    And I agree to that, or in so far\\n    As that I can see no way out but through--\\n    Leastways for me--and then they\\'ll be convinced.\\n    It\\'s not that Len don\\'t want the best for me.\\n    It was his plan our moving over in\\n    Beside the lake from where that day I showed you\\n    We used to live--ten miles from anywhere.\\n    We didn\\'t change without some sacrifice,\\n    But Len went at it to make up the loss.\\n    His work\\'s a man\\'s, of course, from sun to sun,\\n    But he works when he works as hard as I do--\\n    Though there\\'s small profit in comparisons.\\n    (Women and men will make them all the same.)\\n    But work ain\\'t all. Len undertakes too much.\\n    He\\'s into everything in town. This year\\n    It\\'s highways, and he\\'s got too many men\\n    Around him to look after that make waste.\\n    They take advantage of him shamefully,\\n    And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.\\n    We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,\\n    Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk\\n    While I fry their bacon. Much they care!\\n    No more put out in what they do or say\\n    Than if I wasn\\'t in the room at all.\\n    Coming and going all the time, they are:\\n    I don\\'t learn what their names are, let alone\\n    Their characters, or whether they are safe\\n    To have inside the house with doors unlocked.\\n    I\\'m not afraid of them, though, if they\\'re not\\n    Afraid of me. There\\'s two can play at that.\\n    I have my fancies: it runs in the family.\\n    My father\\'s brother wasn\\'t right. They kept him\\n    Locked up for years back there at the old farm.\\n    I\\'ve been away once--yes, I\\'ve been away.\\n    The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\\n    I wouldn\\'t have sent anyone of mine there;\\n    You know the old idea--the only asylum\\n    Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\\n    Rather than send their folks to such a place,\\n    Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.\\n    But it\\'s not so: the place is the asylum.\\n    There they have every means proper to do with,\\n    And you aren\\'t darkening other people\\'s lives--\\n    Worse than no good to them, and they no good\\n    To you in your condition; you can\\'t know\\n    Affection or the want of it in that state.\\n    I\\'ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\\n    My father\\'s brother, he went mad quite young.\\n    Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,\\n    Because his violence took on the form\\n    Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;\\n    But it\\'s more likely he was crossed in love,\\n    Or so the story goes. It was some girl.\\n    Anyway all he talked about was love.\\n    They soon saw he would do someone a mischief\\n    If he wa\\'n\\'t kept strict watch of, and it ended\\n    In father\\'s building him a sort of cage,\\n    Or room within a room, of hickory poles,\\n    Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--\\n    A narrow passage all the way around.\\n    Anything they put in for furniture\\n    He\\'d tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\\n    So they made the place comfortable with straw,\\n    Like a beast\\'s stall, to ease their consciences.\\n    Of course they had to feed him without dishes.\\n    They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\\n    With his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes.\\n    Cruel--it sounds. I \\'spose they did the best\\n    They knew. And just when he was at the height,\\n    Father and mother married, and mother came,\\n    A bride, to help take care of such a creature,\\n    And accommodate her young life to his.\\n    That was what marrying father meant to her.\\n    She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\\n    By his shouts in the night. He\\'d shout and shout\\n    Until the strength was shouted out of him,\\n    And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\\n    He\\'d pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\\n    And let them go and make them twang until\\n    His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\\n    And then he\\'d crow as if he thought that child\\'s play--\\n    The only fun he had. I\\'ve heard them say, though,\\n    They found a way to put a stop to it.\\n    He was before my time--I never saw him;\\n    But the pen stayed exactly as it was\\n    There in the upper chamber in the ell,\\n    A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\\n    I often think of the smooth hickory bars.\\n    It got so I would say--you know, half fooling--\\n    \"It\\'s time I took my turn upstairs in jail\"--\\n    Just as you will till it becomes a habit.\\n    No wonder I was glad to get away.\\n    Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.\\n    I didn\\'t want the blame if things went wrong.\\n    I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\\n    And I looked to be happy, and I was,\\n    As I said, for a while--but I don\\'t know!\\n    Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.\\n    And there\\'s more to it than just window-views\\n    And living by a lake. I\\'m past such help--\\n    Unless Len took the notion, which he won\\'t,\\n    And I won\\'t ask him--it\\'s not sure enough.\\n    I \\'spose I\\'ve got to go the road I\\'m going:\\n    Other folks have to, and why shouldn\\'t I?\\n    I almost think if I could do like you,\\n    Drop everything and live out on the ground--\\n    But it might be, come night, I shouldn\\'t like it,\\n    Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,\\n    And be glad of a good roof overhead.\\n    I\\'ve lain awake thinking of you, I\\'ll warrant,\\n    More than you have yourself, some of these nights.\\n    The wonder was the tents weren\\'t snatched away\\n    From over you as you lay in your beds.\\n    I haven\\'t courage for a risk like that.\\n    Bless you, of course, you\\'re keeping me from work,\\n    But the thing of it is, I need to be kept.\\n    There\\'s work enough to do--there\\'s always that;\\n    But behind\\'s behind. The worst that you can do\\n    Is set me back a little more behind.\\n    I sha\\'n\\'t catch up in this world, anyway.\\n    I\\'d rather you\\'d not go unless you must.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Apple-picking\\n\\n    MY long two-pointed ladder\\'s sticking through a tree\\n    Toward heaven still,\\n    And there\\'s a barrel that I didn\\'t fill\\n    Beside it, and there may be two or three\\n    Apples I didn\\'t pick upon some bough.\\n    But I am done with apple-picking now.\\n    Essence of winter sleep is on the night,\\n    The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.\\n    I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight\\n    I got from looking through a pane of glass\\n    I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough\\n    And held against the world of hoary grass.\\n    It melted, and I let it fall and break.\\n    But I was well\\n    Upon my way to sleep before it fell,\\n    And I could tell\\n    What form my dreaming was about to take.\\n    Magnified apples appear and disappear,\\n    Stem end and blossom end,\\n    And every fleck of russet showing clear.\\n    My instep arch not only keeps the ache,\\n    It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.\\n    I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.\\n    And I keep hearing from the cellar bin\\n    The rumbling sound\\n    Of load on load of apples coming in.\\n    For I have had too much\\n    Of apple-picking: I am overtired\\n    Of the great harvest I myself desired.\\n    There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,\\n    Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.\\n    For all\\n    That struck the earth,\\n    No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,\\n    Went surely to the cider-apple heap\\n    As of no worth.\\n    One can see what will trouble\\n    This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.\\n    Were he not gone,\\n    The woodchuck could say whether it\\'s like his\\n    Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,\\n    Or just some human sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Code\\n\\n    THERE were three in the meadow by the brook\\n    Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay,\\n    With an eye always lifted toward the west\\n    Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud\\n    Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger\\n    Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly\\n    One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,\\n    Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.\\n    The town-bred farmer failed to understand.\\n    \"What is there wrong?\"\\n    \"Something you just now said.\"\\n    \"What did I say?\"\\n    \"About our taking pains.\"\\n    \"To cock the hay?--because it\\'s going to shower?\\n    I said that more than half an hour ago.\\n    I said it to myself as much as you.\"\\n    \"You didn\\'t know.

No one liked the boss.\\n    He was one of the kind sports call a spider,\\n    All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy\\n    From a humped body nigh as big\\'s a biscuit.\\n    But work! that man could work, especially\\n    If by so doing he could get more work\\n    Out of his hired help. I\\'m not denying\\n    He was hard on himself. I couldn\\'t find\\n    That he kept any hours--not for himself.\\n    Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:\\n    I\\'ve heard him pounding in the barn all night.\\n    But what he liked was someone to encourage.\\n    Them that he couldn\\'t lead he\\'d get behind\\n    And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing--\\n    Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.\\n    I\\'d seen about enough of his bulling tricks\\n    (We call that bulling). I\\'d been watching him.\\n    So when he paired off with me in the hayfield\\n    To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.\\n    I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders\\n    Combed it down with a rake and says, \\'O. K.\\'\\n    Everything went well till we reached the barn\\n    With a big catch to empty in a bay.\\n    You understand that meant the easy job\\n    For the man up on top of throwing down\\n    The hay and rolling it off wholesale,\\n    Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.\\n    You wouldn\\'t think a fellow\\'d need much urging\\n    Under these circumstances, would you now?\\n    But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,\\n    And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,\\n    Shouts like an army captain, \\'Let her come!\\'\\n    Thinks I, D\\'ye mean it? \\'What was that you said?\\'\\n    I asked out loud, so\\'s there\\'d be no mistake,\\n    \\'Did you say, Let her come?\\' \\'Yes, let her come.\\'\\n    He said it over, but he said it softer.\\n    Never you say a thing like that to a man,\\n    Not if he values what he is. God, I\\'d as soon\\n    Murdered him as left out his middle name.\\n    I\\'d built the load and knew right where to find it.\\n    Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for\\n    Like meditating, and then I just dug in\\n    And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.\\n    I looked over the side once in the dust\\n    And caught sight of him treading-water-like,\\n    Keeping his head above. \\'Damn ye,\\' I says,\\n    \\'That gets ye!\\' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.\\n    That was the last I saw or heard of him.\\n    I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.\\n    As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,\\n    And sort of waiting to be asked about it,\\n    One of the boys sings out, \\'Where\\'s the old man?\\'\\n    \\'I left him in the barn under the hay.\\n    If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.\\'\\n    They realized from the way I swobbed my neck\\n    More than was needed something must be up.\\n    They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.\\n    They told me afterward. First they forked hay,\\n    A lot of it, out into the barn floor.\\n    Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.\\n    I guess they thought I\\'d spiked him in the temple\\n    Before I buried him, or I couldn\\'t have managed.\\n    They excavated more. \\'Go keep his wife\\n    Out of the barn.\\' Someone looked in a window,\\n    And curse me if he wasn\\'t in the kitchen\\n    Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet\\n    Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.\\n    He looked so clean disgusted from behind\\n    There was no one that dared to stir him up,\\n    Or let him know that he was being looked at.\\n    Apparently I hadn\\'t buried him\\n    (I may have knocked him down); but my just trying\\n    To bury him had hurt his dignity.\\n    He had gone to the house so\\'s not to meet me.\\n    He kept away from us all afternoon.\\n    We tended to his hay. We saw him out\\n    After a while picking peas in his garden:\\n    He couldn\\'t keep away from doing something.\"\\n    \"Weren\\'t you relieved to find he wasn\\'t dead?\"\\n    \"No! and yet I don\\'t know--it\\'s hard to say.\\n    I went about to kill him fair enough.\"\\n    \"You took an awkward way.

The day began uncertain,\\n    With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.\\n    The young folk held some hope out to each other\\n    Till well toward noon when the storm settled down\\n    With a swish in the grass. \"What if the others\\n    Are there,\" they said. \"It isn\\'t going to rain.\"\\n    Only one from a farm not far away\\n    Strolled thither, not expecting he would find\\n    Anyone else, but out of idleness.\\n    One, and one other, yes, for there were two.\\n    The second round the curving hillside road\\n    Was a girl; and she halted some way off\\n    To reconnoitre, and then made up her mind\\n    At least to pass by and see who he was,\\n    And perhaps hear some word about the weather.\\n    This was some Stark she didn\\'t know. He nodded.\\n    \"No fête to-day,\" he said.\\n    \"It looks that way.\"\\n    She swept the heavens, turning on her heel.\\n    \"I only idled down.\"\\n    \"I idled down.\"\\n    Provision there had been for just such meeting\\n    Of stranger cousins, in a family tree\\n    Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch\\n    Of the one bearing it done in detail--\\n    Some zealous one\\'s laborious device.\\n    She made a sudden movement toward her bodice,\\n    As one who clasps her heart. They laughed together.\\n    \"Stark?\" he inquired. \"No matter for the proof.\"\\n    \"Yes, Stark.

It can\\'t be helped though:\\n    Pressed into service means pressed out of shape.\\n    Somehow I\\'ll make it right with her--she\\'ll see.\\n    She\\'s going to do my scouting in the field,\\n    Over stone walls and all along a wood\\n    And by a river bank for water flowers,\\n    The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,\\n    And at the sinus under water a fist\\n    Of little fingers all kept down but one,\\n    And that thrust up to blossom in the sun\\n    As if to say, \\'You! You\\'re the Heart\\'s desire.\\'\\n    Anne has a way with flowers to take the place\\n    Of that she\\'s lost: she goes down on one knee\\n    And lifts their faces by the chin to hers\\n    And says their names, and leaves them where they are.\"\\n    The lawyer wore a watch the case of which\\n    Was cunningly devised to make a noise\\n    Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut\\n    At such a time as this. He snapped it now.\\n    \"Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait.\\n    The lawyer man is thinking of his train.\\n    He wants to give me lots and lots of money\\n    Before he goes, because I hurt myself,\\n    And it may take him I don\\'t know how long.\\n    But put our flowers in water first.

Right--there.\"\\n    \"You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here\\n    Where you can\\'t make them. What is it you want?\\n    I\\'ll put you out with Anne.

Don\\'t you be a fool,\\n    You! crumpling folkses legal documents.\\n    Out with it if you\\'ve any real objection.\"\\n    \"Five hundred dollars!\"\\n    \"What would you think right?\"\\n    \"A thousand wouldn\\'t be a cent too much;\\n    You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is\\n    Accepting anything before he knows\\n    Whether he\\'s ever going to walk again.\\n    It smells to me like a dishonest trick.\"\\n    \"I think--I think--from what I heard to-day--\\n    And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----\"\\n    \"What did you hear, for instance?\" Willis said.\\n    \"Now the place where the accident occurred----\"\\n    The Broken One was twisted in his bed.\\n    \"This is between you two apparently.\\n    Where I come in is what I want to know.\\n    You stand up to it like a pair of cocks.\\n    Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me.\\n    When you come back, I\\'ll have the papers signed.\\n    Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen.\\n    One of you hold my head up from the pillow.\"\\n    Willis flung off the bed. \"I wash my hands--\\n    I\\'m no match--no, and don\\'t pretend to be----\"\\n    The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen.\\n    \"You\\'re doing the wise thing: you won\\'t regret it.\\n    We\\'re very sorry for you.\"\\n    Willis sneered:\\n    \"Who\\'s we?--some stockholders in Boston?\\n    I\\'ll go outdoors, by gad, and won\\'t come back.\"\\n    \"Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come.\\n    Yes. Thanks for caring. Don\\'t mind Will: he\\'s savage.\\n    He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers.\\n    You don\\'t know what I mean about the flowers.\\n    Don\\'t stop to try to now.

The view was all in lines\\n    Straight up and down of tall slim trees\\n    Too much alike to mark or name a place by\\n    So as to say for certain I was here\\n    Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.\\n    A small bird flew before me. He was careful\\n    To put a tree between us when he lighted,\\n    And say no word to tell me who he was\\n    Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.\\n    He thought that I was after him for a feather--\\n    The white one in his tail; like one who takes\\n    Everything said as personal to himself.\\n    One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.\\n    And then there was a pile of wood for which\\n    I forgot him and let his little fear\\n    Carry him off the way I might have gone,\\n    Without so much as wishing him good-night.\\n    He went behind it to make his last stand.\\n    It was a cord of maple, cut and split\\n    And piled--and measured, four by four by eight.\\n    And not another like it could I see.\\n    No runner tracks in this year\\'s snow looped near it.\\n    And it was older sure than this year\\'s cutting,\\n    Or even last year\\'s or the year\\'s before.\\n    The wood was grey and the bark warping off it\\n    And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis\\n    Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.\\n    What held it though on one side was a tree\\n    Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,\\n    These latter about to fall. I thought that only\\n    Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\\n    Could so forget his handiwork on which\\n    He spent himself, the labour of his axe,\\n    And leave it there far from a useful fireplace\\n    To warm the frozen swamp as best it could\\n    With the slow smokeless burning of decay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGood Hours\\n\\n    I HAD for my winter evening walk--\\n    No one at all with whom to talk,\\n    But I had the cottages in a row\\n    Up to their shining eyes in snow.\\n    And I thought I had the folk within:\\n    I had the sound of a violin;\\n    I had a glimpse through curtain laces\\n    Of youthful forms and youthful faces.\\n    I had such company outward bound.\\n    I went till there were no cottages found.\\n    I turned and repented, but coming back\\n    I saw no window but that was black.\\n    Over the snow my creaking feet\\n    Disturbed the slumbering village street\\n    Like profanation, by your leave,\\n    At ten o\\'clock of a winter eve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of North of Boston, by Robert Frost\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NORTH OF BOSTON ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 3026-8.txt or 3026-8.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/2/3026/\\n\\nProduced by David Reed\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
