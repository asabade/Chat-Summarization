      "Nandini: Thank you for the confirmation, Subscription Terms:\\n\\nYour subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel. You authorize us to store your payment method(s) and to automatically charge your payment method(s) every month until you cancel. We will automatically charge you the then-current rate for your plan, plus applicable taxes (such as VAT or GST if the rate does not include it), every month of your annual contract until you cancel.\\n\\nWe may change your plan’s rate each annual renewal term, and we will notify you of any rate change with the option to cancel. If the applicable VAT or GST rate (or other included tax or duty) changes during your one-year term, we will accordingly adjust the tax-inclusive price for your plan mid-term on your next billing date.\\nIf your primary payment method fails, you authorize us to charge any other payment method in your account. \n",

You can edit your payment information anytime in your Adobe Account page.\\n\\nFor European Economic Area customers, your bank may require you to authenticate your initial purchase using a password, a one-time code sent to your mobile number, or biometric recognition. When you authenticate, you also authorize us to charge your payment method for your additional purchases without providing us further payment information or other instructions (i.e., we will initiate future payments independently). Such additional purchases may occur when we automatically charge your payment method in connection with a recurring subscription or when you add or change licenses or products. \n",

      "Ishant: Subscription Terms:\\n\\nYour subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew on your annual renewal date until you cancel. You authorize us to store your payment method(s) and to automatically charge your payment method(s) every month of your annual contract until you cancel. We will automatically charge you the then-current rate for your plan, plus applicable taxes (such as VAT or GST if the rate does not include it), every month of your annual contract until you cancel.\\n\\nWe may change your plan’s rate each annual renewal term, and we will notify you of any rate change with the option to cancel. If the applicable VAT or GST rate (or other included tax or duty) changes during your one-year term, we will accordingly adjust the tax-inclusive price for your plan mid-term on your next billing date.\\n\\nIf your primary payment method fails, you authorize us to charge any other payment method in your account. If you have not provided us a backup payment method(\n",
      "  Ishant: s) and you fail to provide payment, or if all payment methods in your account fail, we may suspend your subscription. You can edit your payment information anytime in your Adobe Account page.\\n\\nFor European Economic Area customers, your bank may require you to authenticate your initial purchase using a password, a one-time code sent to your mobile number, or biometric recognition. When you authenticate, you also authorize us to charge your payment method for your additional purchases without providing us further payment information or other instructions (i.e., we will initiate future payments independently). Such additional purchases may occur when we automatically charge your payment method in connection with a recurring subscription or when you add or change licenses or products.\\n\\nWe may verify your academic status at any time to confirm eligibility for education pricing. If it is determined you are not eligible, we may suspend your account or move you to the then current, non-education subscription pricing.\n",

You must purchase these essentially as one-offs by using credit packs. So, if you have a subscription plan for 10 standard assets a month, you would only be able to download photos, vectors, illustrations, and music tracks. If you wanted to download videos, you could not do it under this plan, but must purchase credit packs.  \n",

A Lightroom Classic catalog is essentially a database and, like every other database, it can get corrupt.\\n\\nIn most of the cases, the catalog gets corrupt due to a hardware or operating system-level issue. These can include system crash, hardware fault, or power outage, any of which can prevent Lightroom Classic to access the catalog safely.\n",
